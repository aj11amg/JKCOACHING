                    <h2>What is coaching?</h2>

                    <p>Many people still think of "coaching" as being associated with sports. Every top athlete has a
                        coach
                        however, in the last few years, coaching has become applicable in every area, in business and in
                        people's
                        personal lives and like sport it has proven to achieve results for individuals.</p>

                    <p>Today, it is quite normal for someone to see a coach to help them achieve their goals in their
                        personal/professional life, health, confidence building, resilience building, personal
                        empowerment. Whilst
                        individuals running their own businesses also find it useful to have a coach to talk through
                        some of the
                        issues that they face and help them to plan to move forward with their business planning.</p>

                    <p>Coaching enables individuals to make a change, learn something new about themselves, achieve
                        goals and hence
                        reach their full potential. The 'coach through dialogue' helps the coachee (client) to correctly
                        set a goal,
                        find the best way to achieve it and discover hidden inner potential in themselves. The coach
                        does not tell the
                        coachee how to achieve their goals or success but asks thought provoking questions which enables
                        the client to
                        find the answers within themselves.</p>

                    <p>I work with clients to identify what some of these goals might be and help them take the
                        necessary steps to
                        change these patterns and "re-wire the brain" thereby clients can reach their goals, their true
                        potential and
                        so lead a more fulfilling work-life balance.</p>

                    <p>Finding answers for themselves through this process can have a profound impact on the client and
                        therefore on
                        their confidence, motivation, moral, mental health, performance and productivity.</p>

                    <h3>The Power of NLP</h3>

                    <p>By using Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) – the study of human excellence – I can help clients
                        see how
                        they form patterns of behaviours, positive and negative, in the past or present and how these
                        affect them.
                    </p>

                    <p>NLP, through coaching, can help individuals change these patterns, become clear about what it is
                        they want
                        and discover the benefits of change for them. NLP allows individuals to achieve their goals and
                        ambitions in
                        their professional and personal lives.</p>

    <section class="coaching-partnership">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Coaching is a partnership between coach and client</h2>
            <p class="partnership-intro">The coach helps the client to achieve their personal best and to produce the
                results
                they want in their personal and professional lives. Coaching ensures the client can give their best,
                learn about
                themselves and make profound changes to their lives.</p>

            <div class="partnership-closing">
                <p>Whether working on a 1:1 basis, or in teams, I help clients to identify what is limiting their
                    beliefs and
                    patterns and partner with them to break these. I am noted for my calm and relaxed manner and enjoy
                    creating a
                    safe space for my clients to think freely, visualise what is possible for them and encourage them to
                    take
                    concrete steps towards achieving their goals and dreams.</p>

                <p>My greatest satisfaction is to see clients create change in themselves and or teams, and reach for
                    their
                    ultimate goals. More importantly, I fully appreciate what an honour it is to be a coach and for
                    individuals to
                    share their personal/professional lives with me and to allow me into this space.</p>
