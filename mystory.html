  <!-- ===================== JAMELA`S PROFILE ===================== -->
  <section class="profile-section">
    <div class="container profile-grid">
      <div class="profile-text">
        <span class="section-tag">Jamela`s Profile</span>
        <p class="italic-lead">I am a businesswoman entrepreneur who is passionate about helping people with
          their careers, personal
          development as well as help people manage their business growth. I work on Performance and
          Development
          Coaching (inc confidence building) Personal/Life Coaching, Business and Leadership coaching, and
          Team
          Coaching.</p>

        <p>The pandemic has given individuals a realisation about changes not only in their professional lives
          but also
          their personal lives. Individuals and teams are changing in the way we are working. I work with
          individuals and
          teams to get them focused on their goals and to <strong>visualise what is possible and take the
            concrete steps
            necessary to get closer to their dreams.</strong></p>

        <p>I juggled a family life and a career to achieve my Open University degree over a period of 6 years
          and value this
          highly. My career has spanned from working in banking, managing an apprenticeship scheme in a local
          authority, studying part time for my degree to finally setting up my own company. So, I never had it
          easy and
          fully understand the commitments individuals have to juggle in their day-to-day life!</p>

        <p>I am passionate as well as committed about challenging women’s stereotypes and the challenges and
          assumptions individuals face around their identity. <em>“The power of greatness lives within each
            one of us”.</em> –
          <strong>Wilma Rudolph</strong> and this is something I feel very strongly about and would relish the
          opportunity to work with
          you and help you to focus on the greatness that is within you!
        </p>

        <p>My clients range from individuals who want to build on their confidence to move onto new jobs, as
          well as
          women who want to make lifestyles changes and get back onto the career ladder. Young people who are
          not
          sure what career to embark on, or are experiencing anxiety and or fear of the unknown due to the
          pandemic.</p>

        <p>As a certified team Coach I work with leaders, helping them to focus on their leadership style and
          lead by
          example.
          When Team coaching is required, I work with teams using the Systemic Team model, collaboratively
          exploring
          their purpose, understanding each other first, then their role in the team. Engagement in the
          Systemic team
          coaching model, involves coaching all members of the team-individually as well as in group settings.
          In
          individual coaching, the focus is on what the person wants to learn/develop along with what would
          make
          him/her a more effective and collaborative team member. The team coaching is designed to look at the
          team
          dynamics, the interpersonal relationships, the perceptions and assumption, different end goals, and
          its
          stakeholders. For a team to grow, it needs to align its culture, and create trust, Systemic team
          coaching allows
          individuals to align their individual goals with organisational goals, leading to higher performing
          teams.</p>

        <p>My coaching style enables clients to maximise their potential and achieve personal and/or
          professional goals. I
          bring invaluable experience to my role as a coach - my passion has always been on the professional
          development of individuals and or teams and to motivate them to reach their full potential.</p>

        <p>Originally from Kenya I have spent most of my adult life in England and support a children’s charity
          in
          Mombasa in Kenya. Having been on a sabbatical to Kenya many years ago I have since supported the
          orphanage in Mombasa, where I have spent many summers supporting the young children, as well as the
          older
          ones with helping them to look at entrepreneurship as a means of generating an income stream to
          bring them
          out of poverty.</p>

          Party in May 2019- which was a great honour.</p>

        <p>I have worked on strategic partnerships in the London area to explore the skills shortages within the
          different sectors and worked with companies on their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) agenda to
          design programmes to benefit and improve the quality of life of young people upon leaving education.

        <p><strong>Entrepreneurship:</strong> In the last 25 years, I have set up two companies, and merged with
          another to
          service the schools, colleges, and universities within West London, servicing over 15,000 thousand
          students on an annual basis, with a highly dedicated team.</p>

        <p><strong>People management:</strong> I have extensive experience of managing staff and managed teams
          of 20 people,
          as well as initiated companies to look at how their staff could develop their own personal skills by
          being involved the company’s community skills and education programmes initiatives and to raise
          their own profiles as well as the company’s.</p>

          teachers and senior leadership teams within the education sector.</p>
